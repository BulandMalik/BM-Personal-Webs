Why we need single page app?
  mobile is more hot, lesser data flows better it is
  open source project/api's
    GITHub UI

  AngularJS vs React
    AngularJS
      HTML is simply a document publishing source. Lets use HTML as its built to server apps using Directives
        Directives
          Custom Angular Elements
          Custom Angular Attributes --- like 'ng-app or ng-init'
      Two way Data Binding
    React
      favors java script vs Angular favors HTML
      React one way data bind
      light weight and angular come with its batteries (like http etc.)
      Testing React app is bit more work as compare to AngularJS

    ******iffy - Immediately-invoked function expression
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression
      (function() {
        // the code here is executed once in its own scope
        angular.module('myapp',[]);
      })();

    Two scopes in JS
      Function Scopes
      Global Scopes
---------

  npm install -g live-server
    live-server
  npm install -g bower
  bower install angular (creates bower-components)

  go inside bower_components/angular
  mkdir src
  touch index.js

  {{}} ----- way to define Angular expressions
  ng-init
  ng-app
  ng-bind --- similar to ng-module
    one way data flow
    ng-model is a two way data flow
  ng-bind-template ----- any expression
  ng-model
  ng-click
  ng-repeat - looping construct
    creates another scope
    $index
    $even/$odd
    $first
    $last
  ng-if - true/false
  ng-minlength/ng-maxlength/required

  built in form validations****

  Scopes
    controller creates
    top level
    ng-repeat
    forms creates its own scope

  HTML5 has its own built in validations so we try to not run it as it have clashes with angular

  Forms
    if we set name='someName' than we can do
      FormName.someName.$invalid/$dirty/$error/$error.maxlength/$error.minlength/$required
    button on-click='product.submit' ng-disabled='productForm.$invalid' -- if form have any issues


  ***** orders to scripts tags matters at times in html
